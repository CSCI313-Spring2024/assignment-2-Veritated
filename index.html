          <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Emily Anderson. I am a third year computer science major and music minor student. 
            I am from Elk River, MN. I came here originally double majoring in computer engineering and music but then
             discovered that I am not a big fan of the hardware side of things and that double majoring in two completely 
             separate majors is a bit much for me.
          </p>

            In the future I hope to work in software development. I am not sure exactly what I want within there but I 
            would like to move back to the St. Paul/Minneapolis Area after graduation. I have also looked into machine 
            learning and my capstone is currently focused on using pretrained models to help the company we are contracted 
            with be able to better analyze their advertisments.
