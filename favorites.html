            One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is to play DND with my friends. This makes  
            <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/">Wikidot</a>  one of my favorite sites as it has resources 
            and is much more intuitive and easy to use than the physical copy of the player's handbook is.

            Along these lines, I also regularily use <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> to run these 
            games so our DM can give us a better idea of what is happening especially spatially as most of 
            my group does not have great imaginations when it comes to imagining rooms and remembering where 
            people are in the room. Although this is not a great site (it is not intuitive, especially for a DM) 
            it is the best option we have found and it is free to use.

            Another thing I greatly enjoy is music (as evidenced by my minor) and as such I really enjoy 
            <a href="https://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a> which is a free library of music. I often get and print 
            off my solo repetoire from there. It has a wide variety of pieces and still avoids copywrite by 
            only having the music of composers that have been dead for at least 70 years. This means that I 
            can find just about any music from the Romantic period and prior, although contemporary music is 
            currently harder to find. It also saves me money since I don't have to buy every piece of music I 
            want to learn.

            This is a list of my favorite movies and tv shows. I really enjoy animated things however I don't shy 
            away from live action when it's good.

            This is a list of my favorite and the most memorable books that I have read. I used to read very often 
            and now I don't as much but I still greatly enjoy it when I have the time and focus.
